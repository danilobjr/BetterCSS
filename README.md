Much Better CSS
===============

_This repository is in alpha state. Mode docs and improvements soon. =]_

This project is a quick start to work with a modular and maintainable CSS structure with SASS.

It's framework agnostic, so you can use this to work with projects that uses ASP.NET, Ruby, Java, Node.js, etc. 

Awesome! So, how can I get this?!

### Get Started

1. You'll need to install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org).
2. Open your command line tool (_bash_ for Mac and Linux and _cmd_ for Windows) and check if Node was installed correctlly by typing 
```npm -v```
If it's ok, it will appear the current version of _npm_ in your console like this ```2.5.1```.
3. Create a directory with name like ```Projects``` and navigate to it in your console (to navigate, use ```cd path/to/my/ProjectsFolder```)
4. Clone the project with command 
```git clone https://github.com/danilojrr/BetterCSS.git```
Now you can navigate to the _BetterCSS_ folder with command ```cd BetterCSS```
5. Install grunt client globally
```npm install -g grunt-cli```
6. Done! Just run grunt before any modifications to your sass files
```grunt```

Now you can modify your sass files and see that the styles.css is updated automatically. =]
